					<p>Hi,</p>
					<p>I'm glad you came to visit my site.  My name is Jordan Karlsruher.  In a few months, I will be graduating from Rochester
					Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY with a bachelor of science degree in game design and development.  Of course, I wouldn't
				  have chosen this degree if I didnt love games.  I do love them, but I also love making them.</p>
					<p>Aside from games, I also like developing for Android and for the web.  Check out my work page for more details about some of the projects
					I have worked on.  Feel free to check out my Github page as well and clone or fork any repo you like. </p>
					<p>If you would like to get in contact with me, go to my contact page and find out how.  I am really easy to get a hold of.</p>
					<p>Hope you enjoy the site.</p>
					<p>Love,</p>
					<p>Jordan K.</p>
