					<p>Hi,</p></br>
					<p>I'm glad you came to visit my site.  My name is Jordan Karlsruher.  In a few months, I will be graduating from Rochester
					Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY with a bachelor of science degree in game design and development.  Of course, I wouldn't
				  have chosen this degree path if I didnt love games and the technology used to make them.</p></br>

					<p>Aside from games, I also enjoy developing for Android and for the web.  Check out my <a class="word-btn" href="./work.html">work page</a>
						for more details about some of the projects I have worked on.  Feel free to take a look at my Github page as well and clone or fork any repo that you think looks cool. </p></br>
					<p>If you would like to get in contact with me, go to my <a class="word-btn" href="./contact.html">contact page</a> and find out how.  I am really easy to get a hold of.</p>
					<p>Hope you enjoy the site.</p></br>
					<p>Love,</p>
					<p>Jordan K.</p>
