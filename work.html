					<h2><a href="https://github.com/empirical-org/Wordlike">Wordlike</a></h2>
					<p>A simple word game I made while working at Quill.org.  The game is made to teach kids from 5th to 8th grade about synonyms through matching words.
					Players can see realtime player scores and are given challenges to accomplish every level.  I used AngularJS and Firebase to creat this.
					<a href="https://wordlike.org">The game is playable here.</a></p>

					<p>This is a 3D platformer I made in Unity.  You play as a sphere who tries to roll around collecting gems while not falling into pits of lava.  This game
					is only playable with an Xbox controller.</p>
